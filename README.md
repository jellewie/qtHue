# qtHue
A graphic interface for Philips Hue lights made in qt framework.
Is ideally if you want to attach a touchscreen on wall to have control of all lights from one place.

Working:
 - groups on/off, brightness, color temperature, colors(xy)
 - lights on/off, brightness, color temperature, colors(xy) 
 - turn on/off all the lights
 - scenes
 - show [weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 
 ToDo:
   - ~~provide precompiled binaries for RaspberryPi, Windows, Linux and MacOS.~~

Build and tested with my project [diyHue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/diyHue), but must also work will official bridge and other emulator that work with hue api protocol.
